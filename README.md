# Python Challenge

## PyBank
* Calculated change from previous profit/losses by storing values in the change_from_previous list, and then making the stored values change along with the csv reader using the loop
* Calculated average change by using sum of change_from_previous and dividing it by the total count of change_from_previous minus 1 (accounting for the number of changes, which is one less than the count)

## PyPoll:
* Created a list of candidates, their respective votes
* Determined the winner of the election and the percentage of votes
